# Coding with Calie


Front end learning


Task: *Design image and text how ever you like

- Title
- Image display 

Use the following website links to learn the basic properties of html and css to complete this task: 

- http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp
- http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp
- http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_headings.asp
- http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_paragraphs.asp
- http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_styles.asp
- http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp

I highly recommend using one of these 2 text editors:

- https://atom.io/
- https://www.geany.org/Download/Releases 

(Note: Atom.io has the one of the highest ratings)
